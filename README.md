## Dependancies
We will be using the following NPM for our app:

* [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) & [Sequelize-Cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-cli) - We will be using sequelize for models and database configuration.
* [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - DotEnv will keep our mysql password secret and safe.
